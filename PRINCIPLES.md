## Design Principles

We'll list the design principles that one should keep in mind while design solution for a given problem.

1. `Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you alter or extend the parts 
that vary without affecting those that don't.`
2. `Program to an interface, not an implementation.`
3. `Favor composition over inheritance`
