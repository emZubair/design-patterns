We'll list the design principles that one should keep in mind while design solution for a given problem.

### OOP Basics
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance

### OOP Principles

1. `Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you alter or extend the parts 
that vary without affecting those that don't.`
2. `Program to an interface, not an implementation.`
3. `Favor composition over inheritance`
4. `Stive for loosely coupled designs between the objects that interact.`
5. `Classes should be open for extension but closed for modifications`
6. `Dependency Inversion Pricinple, Depend upon abstactions or intefaces instead of concrete classes`


#### Loose Coupling
Two objects are loosely coupled when they interact with each other but have very little knowledge of each other.
