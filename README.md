## Designs Patterns (Python)

This repo contains GOF's design's patterns. Each patterns is covered inside separate module, which contains 
the definition about the patterns and python code. 
There is always a need to design a system, and like all system in the software engineering change is the most 
predictable factor. All the design patterns provide a way to `let some part of the systems vary independantly of 
the other parts`, it can be described as below.

```markdown
Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you alter or extend the parts 
that vary without affecting those that don't.
```
